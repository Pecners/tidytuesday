About
================

The purpose of this repo is to house my code and visualization products
for [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

My aim in participating in TidyTuesday is to quickly produce and share
work. To that end, I will limit the amount of time I spend each week so
that I don’t get stuck in the perfectionist trap. The time limit I’m
starting with is 90 minutes, but if I can keep it to 60 minutes, all the
better.
